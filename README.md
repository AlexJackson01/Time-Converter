# Time Converter

#### Challenge Day 1 of Paul Hudson's '100 Days of SwiftUI'. A unit converter app; for mine, I chose time conversion using seconds, minutes, hours and days.

#### It takes the number provided in the input, converts it into seconds first before converting it to the chosen 'From' unit and displaying the output.
